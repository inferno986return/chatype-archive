The [Chatype website](http://chatype.com/) is gone so I've created an archive. I'm not a Chattanoogan or even a US citizen (infact I can barely find Tennessee on a map of the USA), but I do appreciate interesting typography and have provided a copy of the contents of the original .zip file that was available as a free download. The important EULA which specifies the intended usage of Chatype has copied into LICENSE.md with minor formatting changes. I have kept the original .rtf for posterity.

According to Whois, the chatype.com domain will expire later this year; I am intrigued to see if it will be renewed by the project's owners or not.

**Chatype** was a bespoke slab-serif typeface created for promoting the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The creators claim this is the first bespoke typeface designed for an American city making Chatype a unique project.

As a legacy the Chatype font is still used by the [https://chattlib.org/](Chattanooga Public Library) as of July 2021, in the main logo, a promotional video titled [*Welcome Back!*](https://youtu.be/zQdcWwvcThs) and a logo for online service chattliberary.tv with Chatype's unique "ch" ligature.
