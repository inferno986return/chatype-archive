Chatype is the first municipal typeface in the United States, and the first kickstarted and created by the people of the city, for the people. We want discuss the Chatype spirit with you. Some of the vision we’ve had for Chatype since the very beginning has helped inform and fuel this process, and now that we’ve gotten to this point, it’s important to us to pass along some of our hopes and purposes for this typeface so you can help us protect what we’ve tried to create for this city.  

First, the font can only be used for Chattanooga oriented projects. It has to in some way have something to do with Chattanooga or be geographically related. You’re welcome to use Chatype for personal or corporate use, but we’d like to weigh in on those applications. This typeface is made for and dedicated to the identity of Chattanooga. One of the things we love about Chattanooga is all the vibrant culture and unique people living and working here. 

Second, Chatype is free to use for all Chattanooga oriented projects, but as designers, business people and branding experts, we don’t want Chattanooga to lose individual brand identities. We’re excited about local businesses and individuals using Chatype for Chattanooga-oriented marketing and events, but if you want your brand to stand out, you may want to think twice about using Chatype as a logo. Many of you are backers of the project, and Chatype’s exclusivity is its value. We hope that you help us protect that value by using it wisely.

Thirdly, our team has authored this typeface and we’ve put a lot of time and thought and effort into this. We’ll continue to safeguard it while making it freely available to the City of Chattanooga and Chattanooga’s citizens. As you can't say that you own it, please do not modify, rename, bundle with other software products, or redistribute it as your own. We really care about this being available to our city, so we’re not charging anything for it, but a lot of that is because we believe the best about you. 

We ask you to refrain from using Chatype in any political campaign or in an immoral or defaming situation, even if they are about or directed towards Chattanoogans.

We would love it if you would credit all the individual Chatype members or indicate that the type is set in Chatype, but if that is not practical it’s not necessary. 

We have web fonts available and we hope that you can put them to good use. We have some instructions available that show you how you can install Chatype.

If you have any questions about the font, or find a bug or somesuch nonsense please feel free to get in touch with us by connecting on Twitter, Facebook, or emailing info@chatype.com.
